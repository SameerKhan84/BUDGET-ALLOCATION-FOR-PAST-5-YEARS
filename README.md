# BUDGET-ALLOCATION-FOR-PAST-5-YEARS
This Python-based project automates the analysis and visualization of government budget allocation data over the past five financial years. It removes the need for manual data sorting, filtering, and chart creation by offering an interactive, menu-driven system that lets users instantly generate insights.

Key sectors covered include the Ministry of Defence, Agriculture Subsidies, and Foreign Aid. Users can choose between different ministries and expenditure types, then view data through bar graphs or line charts using Matplotlib. Data handling is streamlined using Pandas, making the entire process fast, accurate, and scalable.

Traditionally, understanding multi-year budget trends involves manually collecting data, organizing it in spreadsheets, and creating charts—tasks that are time-consuming and prone to errors. This project automates that workflow completely, saving time and reducing effort while increasing accuracy. It’s ideal for students, educators, researchers, analysts, and anyone interested in financial data analysis.
